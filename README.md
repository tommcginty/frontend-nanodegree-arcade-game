## Classic Arcade Game Clone
This game is a project for the [Udacity](https://udacity.com) [Front End Web Developer course](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001/).

# Instructions
Play the game [here.](https://tommcginty.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
Get your character to the water safely by avoiding the bugs.
If you hit a bug, back to the beginning you go. If you make it safely to the water you win.
Use:
* **left ←** to move the left
* **right →** to move the right
* **up ↑** to move up
* **down ↓** to move down

# Resources
No external resources are needed to play this game.

# This is a work in progress
Some things I plan on adding:
* A score keeper and timer
* Ability to change character avatars
* Start with three lives, and loose one every time you hit a bugs
* Have random gems appear for extra points
* Have the stone street get wider at certain levels
* Have the bugs move faster as time goes on
* Have the bugs go different directions

Feel free to offer any suggestions.
